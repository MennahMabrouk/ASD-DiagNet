## **Model 1: Autoencoder + SLP (TensorFlow/Keras)**

### **Output of Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
1. **Preprocessed Data**:
   - The output of the preprocessing pipeline is a `.npz` file containing two arrays:
     - `X`: The feature matrix (upper triangle of correlation matrices).
     - `y`: The binary labels (0 for control, 1 for ASD).

2. **Feature Matrix (`X`)**:
   - Each row corresponds to a subject.
   - Each column corresponds to a feature (e.g., a value from the upper triangle of the correlation matrix).
   - The features represent functional connectivity between brain regions.

3. **Labels (`y`)**:
   - A 1D array of binary labels indicating the diagnosis (0: control, 1: ASD).

4. **Key Characteristics**:
   - **Standardized**: The time-series data is standardized (mean-centered and scaled to unit variance).
   - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Only the upper triangle of the correlation matrix is used, reducing the number of features.

### **Practical Implications**:
- **Ease of Use**: The `.npz` file is easy to load and use in TensorFlow/Keras for training.
- **Reproducibility**: The preprocessing steps are standardized, ensuring consistent results across runs.
- **Scalability**: The feature matrix is compact and efficient for training.

## **Model 2: ASD-DiagNet (PyTorch)**

### **Output of Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
1. **Raw and Preprocessed Data**:
   - The output of the preprocessing pipeline is a local directory containing:
     - Raw NIfTI files (`.nii` or `.nii.gz`).
     - Phenotypic data (`Phenotypic_V1_0b.csv`).
     - Preprocessed data (e.g., correlation matrices, eigenvector-based features).

2. **Directory Structure**:
   - **Phenotypic Data**:
     - Stored as a CSV file (`Phenotypic_V1_0b.csv`).
     - Contains diagnostic labels (`DX_GROUP`) and other phenotypic information.
   - **Functional Data**:
     - Stored as NIfTI files in subdirectories (e.g., `rois_cc200`).
     - Each file corresponds to a subject’s fMRI scan.

3. **Key Characteristics**:
   - **Raw Data Access**: Provides access to raw NIfTI files for custom preprocessing.
   - **Custom Preprocessing**: Allows for advanced feature extraction (e.g., eigenvector-based augmentation).
   - **Flexibility**: The directory structure supports a wide range of preprocessing pipelines.

---

### **Practical Implications**:
- **Customizability**: The raw data and directory structure allow for advanced preprocessing tailored to specific needs.
- **Scalability**: The pipeline can handle large datasets but may require significant storage and computational resources.
- **Reproducibility**: Requires careful documentation of preprocessing steps to ensure reproducibility.

## **Key Differences**

### **1. Output Format**:
- **Model 1**: Saves preprocessed data in a `.npz` file, which is easy to load and use.
- **Model 2**: Saves raw and preprocessed data in a local directory, providing more flexibility but requiring additional steps for reuse.

### **2. Feature Representation**:
- **Model 1**: Uses the upper triangle of the correlation matrix as features, reducing dimensionality.
- **Model 2**: Likely uses more advanced feature extraction techniques (e.g., regions of interest, eigenvectors).

### **3. Raw Data Access**:
- **Model 1**: Does not provide access to raw NIfTI files or phenotypic data.
- **Model 2**: Provides access to raw NIfTI files and phenotypic data, enabling advanced analyses.
